The idea of an adventurous climb is linked to a combination of factors in addition to the grade; for example the length of a climb, the availability of protection or its location (e.g. high mountain, remote, inescapable, difficult access or descent).

Multi-pitch sports route can be adventurous such as “Wings for Life” on Telendos (Kalymnos); it is long, relatively remote certainly difficult to escape from and with a good hike over the top and down to the bar!

### Our Mission

> The object of the Club will be to, encourage mountaineering, particularly in England, Ireland, and Wales, and to serve as a bond of union amongst all lovers of mountain climbing. ~ Journal 1898 Vol 1

## Your application starts here

The process of joining the Climbers’ Club is pretty simple and available on-line as the preferred route; like many other clubs we ask you to complete a short application form and have a couple of current members propose and second you.

Don’t worry if you don’t know any members, all you need to do is come along to a few meets so that you can meet members who can then propose and second your application (contact the Meet Coordinator – contact details can be found within the meet information page).

We have special Aspirant Meets which are specifically aimed at ensuring that you can meet a range of members and we recommend that you come to one if possible.

There is no age limit for membership nor is there any limit on the total number of members; provided that you, your proposer and seconder follow our guidance notes and advice, your application will be successful.

Each application is considered on its own overall merits and it is really important that you give us a clear picture of your climbing experience; we will take into account your leading grade, preferred climbing style, breadth and depth of experience and the geographical range of your climbing. There is no secret membership criteria, all the criteria are published; see the FAQs and if you feel that you still need more information or would like to discuss specific aspects of your application don’t hesitate to contact our Membership Secretary.

There are sure to be questions.  Please review the frequently asked questions. If your question is not answered, ask your proposer/seconder and do not hesitate to contact the Hon. Membership Secretary if still stuck.
