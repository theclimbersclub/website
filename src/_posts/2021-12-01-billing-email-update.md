The emails you get from the clubs billing system will now be arriving from a new email domain. This has been done to increase the deliverability of these emails.

In order to rollout new services for the members we're using this domain to save changes to the existing domain that cause problems, technically and for those involved.

Please keep an eye out for emails  from this new domain, which is: _theclimbers.club_
