Thank you for your patience, the revised membership application process is now available. Slightly tweaked from old, however fundamentally the same process. Please read the supporting docs before starting your application.

The club is run by volunteers and in the last six months a series of events have occurred that took us of our original plan. This new process is an interim step to ensure that we can continue to run the club and to ensure that we can continue to provide the best service to our members.

The new help documents can be found here: [Membership Application Overview](/docs/membership/your-application).
