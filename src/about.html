          Our Project
        </h3>
        <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-500">
          This project has come from years of listening and observing duplicated
          effort, costs and time lost. This is bourne by individual clubs, all
          stretching for the same goals.
        </p>
        <div class="mt-5 prose prose-sky text-gray-500">
          <p>
            Most clubs rely on volunteers and goodwill. Processes and system
            have typically evolved, mostly over the last decade. Today's data
            custodians need to be far more alert to the clear and present danger
            of data loss and mis-management. With changes to the law, the
            responsibility of personal data management and a tide of threats to
            user based devices. The risk is present, real and automated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obscurity or only a handful of members isn't a valid defence. So
            with legal and morale challenges, around best endeavours, security,
            hosting, data storage and use. It's only a matter of time till the
            worst happens, you loose or cannot access your club data. Compass
            then, intends to offer a robust, secure & useable system that can
            tackle most of your clubs daily needs. We fully acknowledge some
